<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Power consumption</summary>

  Bare board: `1.10w`<br>
  Maxed out: `5.13w`<br><br>

  ### Bare board
  Board powered on in a headless environment and the CPU set to powersave governor.<br>
  No desktop, No HDMI, No external peripherals, Passive cooling, MicroSD boot device, No Wireless/Wired communication.<br>

  ### Maxed out
  GUI desktop and CPU set to performance governor.<br>
  glmark2-wayland, stress --vm 4 --vm-bytes 128M -c 4, iperf3 --bidir, And active cooling.<br>

  ### Notes
  Unfortunately i don't have another M.2 SSD to test this with so storage/Disk IO is omitted from this test.<br>
  WiFi doesn't seem to work in mainline, Unless i'm doing something wrong, Radio (WiFi/Bluetooth) are omitted.<br>
  NPU Driver is not in mainline currently so that's also omitted.<br>
